# WizSpeek® - Secure AI-Powered Messaging Platform

## Overview

WizSpeek® is a secure, intelligent messaging platform built under the Nebusis® brand. This is a full-stack application that provides real-time messaging capabilities with end-to-end encryption, featuring a modern React frontend, Express.js backend, and PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with local storage
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket client for live messaging
- **Theme Support**: Light/dark mode toggle with CSS variables

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ESM modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with bcrypt for password hashing
- **Real-time**: WebSocket server for instant messaging
- **File Handling**: Multer for file uploads with 10MB limit
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with WebSocket enhancement

### Database Schema
- **Users**: Authentication, profiles, online status
- **Conversations**: Direct and group chat support
- **Messages**: Text, voice, file, and image message types
- **Files**: Attachment metadata and encryption keys
- **Participants**: Many-to-many relationship for conversation membership

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- User registration and login with JWT tokens
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- Token-based API authentication middleware
- Client-side authentication state management

### Real-time Messaging
- WebSocket connections for instant message delivery
- Typing indicators and user presence
- Message read receipts and delivery status
- Connection management with automatic reconnection

### File Management
- File upload support with size limits
- Metadata storage for attachments
- Encrypted file storage (placeholder implementation)
- Image, video, and document support

### Security Features
- End-to-end encryption (simplified implementation for demo)
- JWT token authentication
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS protection and security headers

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Login/register → JWT token → stored in localStorage
2. **Message Flow**: User types → WebSocket sends → Server broadcasts → Recipients receive
3. **File Uploads**: Select file → Upload to server → Store metadata → Share with recipients
4. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connection maintains live state synchronization

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **Database**: @neondatabase/serverless for PostgreSQL connection
- **ORM**: drizzle-orm for database operations
- **Authentication**: jsonwebtoken, bcrypt for security
- **WebSocket**: ws for real-time communication
- **File Handling**: multer for file uploads
- **UI Components**: @radix-ui components with shadcn/ui

### Development Tools
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across the stack
- **Vite**: Fast development server and build tool
- **ESBuild**: Production server bundling
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Mode
- Frontend: Vite dev server with HMR
- Backend: tsx for TypeScript execution
- Database: Neon serverless PostgreSQL
- WebSocket: Integrated with Express server

### Production Build
- Frontend: Vite build to static assets
- Backend: ESBuild bundle for Node.js
- Database: Drizzle migrations for schema management
- Deployment: Single server hosting both frontend and backend

### Environment Configuration
- DATABASE_URL: PostgreSQL connection string
- JWT_SECRET: Token signing secret
- NODE_ENV: Environment mode (development/production)

## Legal Compliance & IP Independence

WizSpeek® is developed with strict compliance to avoid any infringement of Meta/WhatsApp intellectual property:

### Design Independence
- **Original UI/UX**: Custom chat interface design with unique layouts, colors, and interactions
- **WizSpeek® Branding**: Proprietary visual identity distinct from WhatsApp's green-white theme
- **Custom Terminology**: Original feature names (e.g., "SecurePing", "Relay Code") instead of WhatsApp terms
- **Independent Icons**: Custom-designed iconography and visual elements

### Technical Independence  
- **Clean-room Development**: All code written from scratch without reverse engineering
- **Original Architecture**: Proprietary backend design and database schema
- **Independent Encryption**: Custom security implementation without copying Signal Protocol usage
- **Nebusis® Infrastructure**: Self-hosted on company-owned systems

### Feature Differentiation
- **Enhanced 12-option menu** instead of WhatsApp's 4-option layout
- **Device linking with QR codes** using original implementation
- **Group creation** with WizSpeek®-specific workflow
- **Progressive Web App** capabilities for cross-platform deployment
